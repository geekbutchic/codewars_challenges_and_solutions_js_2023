# Codewars Challenge and Solutions

### * Challenge (1) 

In this simple assignment you are given a number and have to make it negative. But maybe the number is already negative?

Solution Notes: 

* Used a comparison operator to determine if num was larger than 0.  If so return num * -1 to negate num since it is a positive num.  

* If num is not larger than 0 return num.
